# Typescript
TypeScript is a strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript, giving you better tooling at any scale.

Benefits:
- Static typing.
- Code completion.
- Refactoring.
- Shorthand notations.

Drawbacks
- Compilation
- Discipline in code


Typescript => Medium and large projects

Javascript => Simple or small projects

## Baisc commands
Compile a file
```bash
tsc index.ts
```
Create  configuration file
```bash
tsc --init
```

## How to debug
- Go to tsconfig.js into your project and set this: "sourceMap": true
- Run debug on VS code and select Node.js as launcher
- This generates a file /home/vacho/projects/JSDeveloper/.vscode/launch.json
